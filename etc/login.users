# /etc/firejail/login.users - restricted user shell configuration
#
# Each user entry consists of a user name and firejail
# program arguments:
#
#       user name: arguments
#
# For example:
#
#       netblue:--net=none --protocol=unix
#
# Wildcard patterns are accepted in the user name field:
#
#       user*: --private
#
# The example will do --private for user1, user2, and so on.
#
# The extra arguments are inserted into program command line if firejail
# was started as a login shell.
