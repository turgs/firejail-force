Warning: this test requires root access to configure a number of bridge, mac
and vlan devices. Please take a look at configure file. By the time you are
finished testing, you'll probably have to reboot the computer to get your
networking subsytem back to normal.

Limitations - to be investigated and fixed:
	- the test is assuming an eth0 wired interface to be present
	- using netstat and ifconfig - this needs to be moved to iproute2
	- configure script inserts an entry in system netfilter configuration
	- the test will probably not work on grsecurity settings
	- macvlan interfaces don't seem to work correctly under VirtualBox

Run the test:
	$ ./network.sh | grep TESTING
